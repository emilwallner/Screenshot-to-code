** Warnings ** 

The data from the Tatoeba Project contains errors.

To lower the number of errors you are likely to see, only
sentences by native speakers and proofread sentences have
been included.

For the non-English language, I made these (possibly wrong)
assumptions.
Assumption 1: Sentences written by native speakers can be
trusted.
Assumption 2: Contributors to the Tatoeba Project are honest
about what their native language is.

For English, I used the sentences that I have proofread
and thought were OK.
Of course, I may have missed a few errors.
