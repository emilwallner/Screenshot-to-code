**A detailed tutorial covering the code in this repository:** [Turning design mockups into code with deep learning](https://emilwallner.medium.com/how-you-can-train-an-ai-to-convert-your-design-mockups-into-html-and-css-cc7afd82fed4).

**Plug:** I write about learning Machine learning online and independent research ðŸ‘‰ [Enjoy!](https://www.emilwallner.com/)


The models are based on Tony Beltramelli's [pix2code](https://github.com/tonybeltramelli/pix2code), and inspired by Airbnb's [sketching interfaces](https://airbnb.design/sketching-interfaces/), and Harvard's [im2markup](https://github.com/harvardnlp/im2markup).

**Note:** only the Bootstrap version can generalize on new design mock-ups. It uses 16 domain-specific tokens which are translated into HTML/CSS. It has a 97% accuracy. The best model uses a GRU instead of an LSTM. This version can be trained on a few GPUs. The raw HTML version has potential to generalize, but is still unproven and requires a significant amount of GPUs to train. The current model is also trained on a homogeneous and small dataset, thus it's hard to tell how well it behaves on more complex layouts.  

An quick overview of the process: 

### 1) Give a design image to the trained neural network

### 2) The neural network converts the image into HTML markup

## Installation

### FloydHub

[![Run on FloydHub](https://static.floydhub.com/button/button.svg)](https://floydhub.com/run?template=https://github.com/floydhub/pix2code-template)

Click this button to open a [Workspace](https://blog.floydhub.com/workspaces/) on [FloydHub](https://www.floydhub.com/?utm_medium=readme&utm_source=pix2code&utm_campaign=aug_2018) where you will find the same environment and dataset used for the *Bootstrap version*. You can also find the trained models for testing.

### Local
``` bash
pip install keras tensorflow pillow h5py jupyter
```
```
git clone https://github.com/emilwallner/Screenshot-to-code.git
cd Screenshot-to-code/
jupyter notebook
```
Go do the desired notebook, files that end with '.ipynb'. To run the model, go to the menu then click on Cell > Run all

The final version, the Bootstrap version, is prepared with a small set to test run the model. If you want to try it with all the data, you need to download the data here: https://www.floydhub.com/emilwallner/datasets/imagetocode, and specify the correct ```dir_name```.
